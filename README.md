## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install Python Dependencies: `pip install web3 selenium webdriver-manager pytest`
3. Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
4. Run tests: `npx hardhat test`
5. (Terminal 1) Start local network: `npx hardhat node`
6. (Terminal 2) Deploy Smart Contract: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
7. (Terminal 3) Start Web Server: `cd webpage`, `python -m http.server 8005`

## Configure MetaMask
### Add Hardhat Local Network:
- Network Name: Hardhat Local
